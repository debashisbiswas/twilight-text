# Twilight Text

This project explores the effect of carefully selected color to highlight
semantic meaning in text, inspired by Nicolas Rougier's [On the design of text
editors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06030).

In the article, Rougier discusses that a restricted set of color with clear
semantic associations can aid reability. This reminded me of the Zelda games,
which would use color to highlight important concepts in text-based dialogue,
and I was inspired to experiment with dynamically implementing this concept
using natural language processing.

## Potential directions

- Smarter highlight detection using lightweight LLMs
- Text "language server": jump to definition, view references, refactor?
